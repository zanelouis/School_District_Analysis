For Maria to analyze her district school test scores
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

2. Get a complete list of students and school data from both data sources.
3. Calculate the average reading/ math scores, percentage of passing reading/ math scores by school
4. Determine the scores by size, type and spending buckets.

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv and student_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1 Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

1. Calculate the ninth graders in Thomas High School.
2. Get a complete list of data excluding Thomas High School ninth graders.
3. Calculate the total number of students excluding Thomas High School ninth graders.
4. Calculate the percentage of math and reading scores excluding Thomas High School ninth graders.
5. Summarize the student testing scores by student spending, school size and school type.

## Challenge Summary
The audit for the school board concluded with:
- The Thomas High School ninth graders list included 461 students
- The total number of students minus the 461 were 38,709 students.
- After removing the scores voided:
